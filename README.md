# Renewind
With the rising global emphasis on sustainability, wind energy has become a crucial part of the renewable energy landscape. However, maintaining wind turbines is a costly challenge, particularly due to unexpected generator failures that lead to high operational expenses.
● The U.S. Department of Energy advocates predictive maintenance as a key strategy for optimizing wind turbine efficiency. 
● By utilizing sensor data and machine learning, predictive maintenance can proactively identify potential failures, allowing for timely repairs that reduce downtime and maintenance costs
# Expected Impact
● By implementing a predictive maintenance strategy, ReneWind can significantly reduce unplanned downtime, optimize repair schedules, and lower operational costs. 
● This initiative supports the broader goal of making wind energy more efficient, reliable, and cost-effective in the long term.
Cost Implications & Optimization Goal
 The model’s predictions will result in different cost outcomes: 
 • True Positives (TP) → Correctly detected failures → Repair cost ($15,000) 
 • False Negatives (FN) → Missed failures → Replacement cost ($40,000) • False Positives (FP) → False alarms → Inspection cost ($5,000)
 Since replacement is the most expensive, the primary goal is to minimize FN while maintaining an optimal trade-off between repair and inspection costs.
# Summary of most important factors
# Conclusion
# Final Model: AdaBoost with Decision Tree (max_depth=3), 200 estimators, learning_rate=0.2
Pipeline ensures consistency in feature scaling and model application
Model achieves high recall (85.1%) while maintaining good precision (77.2%)
Key features identified (V36, V14, V15) should be monitored for failure prediction.
# Final Verdict:
The model successfully meets the objective of minimizing False Negatives (FN) while keeping False Positives (FP) in check.
